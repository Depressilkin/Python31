Feelgood factor is back’: Nagasato rates Japan Women’s Olympics hopes
The former Nadeshiko striker believes Futoshi Ikeda’s team have the talent to reach the semi-finals in Paris
Yuki Nagasato has experienced it all with Japan. From the ecstatic World Cup-winning high of 2011 to the crushing disappointment of failing to qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. The 36-year-old may not be part of the Nadeshiko setup any longer – although she continues to play for Houston Dash at club level – but she expects them to make an impact at the Olympics in Paris, which starts this month. Nagasato left Japan at the age of 22 for fruitful spells with Turbine Potsdam, Chelsea, Eintracht Frankfurt and Chicago Red Stars before joining Houston. She was a mainstay of the golden era Japan side that triumphed at Germany 2011 and won silver at London 2012 before again reaching a World Cup final in Canada in 2015.
